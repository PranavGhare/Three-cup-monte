# Three Cup Monte Game (Python)

This is a simple **Three Cup Monte** game implemented in Python as part of my Python learning journey during my Master’s studies.

The project focuses on building strong fundamentals in Python programming, including list manipulation, functions, randomization, and user input handling.

## 🎯 Game Description
The Three Cup Monte game consists of three cups, where one cup hides an object (`O`).  
The cups are shuffled randomly, and the player has to guess the correct position of the object.

If the guess is correct, the player wins; otherwise, the correct position is revealed.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Run the script or notebook:
   - If using Jupyter Notebook: run all cells
   - If using Python file:
     ```bash
     python three_cup_monte.py
     ```
3. Enter a number (0, 1, or 2) when prompted.
